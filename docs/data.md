title: Data download and plotting

## Introduction
The fridge data can be plotted and viewed on the webpage. To use this feature simply check the check-boxes corresponding to the desired thermometers or pressure gauges, then enter the date and time range in the input boxes underneath "Timeframe". Finally, to plot simply click the "PLOT" button. To download the selected data press the "DOWNLOAD" button, this should open a download manager with a CSV file of the data.

*NOTE: Currently the ability to select data from a certain time window is not working, this will hopefully be rectified soon.*
