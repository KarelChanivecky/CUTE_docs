title: High Temperature Thermometers
---

## Introduction

The high temperature thermometers provide information about the 60K and 4K stages of the fridge, as well as providing a full scale mixing chamber thermometer. The mixing chamber thermometer used is a Cernox thermometer and is therefore capable of providing reasonably accurate measurements from room temperature down to base. 

On the thermometer webpage the first row is the mixing chamber thermometer, the second row is the 4J thermometer, and the third row is the 60K thermometer.

## Instructions
At the start of the cooldown all of the thermometers are required since the full scale Cernox thermometer is used as part of the automated cooldown procedure. To setup the thermometers at the beginning of the cooldown use the parameters in the table below, these parameters should work at low temperatures as well

| Thermometer | MODE | I MODE | I RANGE | 
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | 
| Mixing chamber | FIX CURRENT | AUTO RANGE  | N/A | 
| Cold plate | FIX VOLTAGE | AUTO RANGE  | N/A | 
| Still | FIX VOLTAGE | AUTO RANGE  | N/A |
