## Introduction
To minimize vibrations coupling in to the detector, the lower part of the cryostat is decoupled from the top by soft bellows. The top of the cryostat affixes the pulse tube cooler's rotary valve and the turbo pump to the drywell; the lower part part of the cryostat is mounted on a suspension frame that is connected to three independent dampers, in this way the lower part of the cryostat is effectively floating. Since the inner part of the bellows is under vacuum, pressure
fluctuations in the lab can cause the position of the cryostat to shift, so each damper is controlled using a movable stage. 

## Usage
The position of the three dampers (labelled A, B, and C) is shown in the sliding bars. This is the calibrated position of the dampers in millimeters, and can range from 0-2 mm.

### Active control
Currently the active control mode is the only automated control available through the web interface. To enable the active control simply click the toggle button in the Active Control panel.

## Other functions
In the near future the CMD buttons will be implemented with various control options.
