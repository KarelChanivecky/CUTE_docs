## Introduction
A Ba-133 source provides high energy photons to the detector. The source can be lowered down into the lead shields via a connected string to a stepper motor. The control panel on the web interface provides a way for users to control the source position for detector calibrations.

## Instructions

### Basic usage
The current source position is indicated on the slider by the green square; a position of -10 cm corresponds to the source being fully retracted into it's lead housing. The source position can be set by clicking and dragging on the blue square on the slider bar, or by typing the desired position in the input box next to the slider; the source can be moved to the desired position by clicking the MOVE button.  

### Alternate operation
Another way to move the source is to use the fixed speed mode. In this case the source can be driven either up or down at a fixed speed. To use this mode, select the desired speed in the MotorSpeed input box, and then choose the direction by clicking on either the UP or DOWN button. To stop the source, press the STOP button.  

*NOTE: By using the fixed speed mode it is possible to drive the source too far in either direction and risk dropping the source in the drywell, therefore extreme caution should be taken when using this mode. The main use case is so on-site personnel can easily retrieve the source if the position is unknown.*
